# pFabric_Implementation

 In the given project, we work through a sample implementation of the pfabric by simulating its algorithm in a python environment.

link to code: https://github.com/HarshitaSingh47/pFabric_Implementation.git

### How to run the code


#### Input 
1. The code takes csv files that contain some sample flows and flow sizes as input
2. The user can use some of the pre-made flow examples to test the code
3. On prompt: type "1" or "2" depending on the flow you want to choose


#### Output

The output consists of an updated buffer with every Enqueue and Dequeue process. 
When packets are dropped based on priority, it is printed in the logs to reflect the same.

###### Exiting the Code
Currently, the script needs to be manually terminated. I am working on finxing this in the next commit.
